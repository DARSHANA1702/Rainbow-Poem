# Rainbow-Poem
A repository for my poem

**LIFE IS LIKE A ONE WAY ROAD,
WE ARE LIKE  VEHICLE RUNNING ON IT.**

**LOTS OF TWIST AND TURNS ARE THERE,
BUT NEVER GET A CHANCE TO GET "U" TURN ANYWHERE"**

**LIFE IS LIKE A RAINBOW ,
HAVING DIFFRENT COLOURS ,
SHOWING SOUR AND SWEET MOMENTS,
BE THERE TO EXPERIENCE EVRY FALOVOURS,
SO ENJOY LIFE TO FULLEST MY DEAR"**
